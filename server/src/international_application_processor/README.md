# International Application Processor

This package reads form submissions from https://dxe.io/join and sends emails
to the person who responded to the form inviting them to get involved, called
the "**onboarding**" email, as well as to existing organizers or coordinators,
called the "**notification**" email.

Please keep the logic in this package in sync with [this Google Doc][doc] for
email authors to see the emails that are sent and to suggest changes.

Further related documentation for this mechanism can be found in [Coda][coda].
